# Peter Aldhous: NICAR 2018, Chicago


###[Getting started with machine learning for reporting](machine-learning.html)

####**Thursday March 8, 4.45pm**
#####**Location: Grand Ballroom 1**

**Panel with Rachel Shorey, *New York Times*, Anthony Pesce, *Los Angeles Times*, Chase Davis, *Minnesota Star Tribune***

Many tasks in journalism boil down to classification problems. Is my city's police department cooking its crime stats by assigning incident reports to the wrong categories? Of the thousands of planes in the air each day, which ones might be involved in government surveillance? Is this person I just snapped on my cellphone a Member of Congress?

Drawing on examples including the *Los Angeles Times'* [investigation](http://www.latimes.com/local/cityhall/la-me-crime-stats-20151015-story.html) into the misclassification of violent crimes by the LAPD, *BuzzFeed News'* [identification](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/hidden-spy-planes) of spy planes operating in U.S. airspace, and a *New York Times* [service](https://github.com/newsdev/who_the_hill) that can identify Members of Congress from photos sent by SMS message (used in [this story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/us/politics/pro-trump-fundraising-trump-hotel.html)), we'll address questions including:

I'm not a data scientist, I'm a reporter. What's in it for me? What type of story or reporting task can machine learning help with? When is machine learning *not* the answer? Which algorithm should I choose? How can I structure my data to give the algorithm more to work with?

###[Data analysis and plotting in R](r-analysist.html)

####**Friday March 9, 10.15am**
#####**Location: Northwestern/Ohio St**

You'll learn how to use the **[dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)** package to sort, filter, join and carry out some other basic functions in R to identify trends in your data. We'll also make some simple charts with **[ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/)**.
